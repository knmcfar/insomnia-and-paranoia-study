# Investigation of Effects of Insomnia on Paranoia 

An individual report was created for the BIOST 579: Data Analysis and Reporting in which I conducted an exploratory analysis of the association between insomnia and paranoia using cross-sectional survey data and logistic regression.

# Contents

The report, presentation slides, code, and dataset are uploaded to this repository. If the dataset is saved to the same directory that the working directory is set to, the dataset can be imported to R directly using the code.

# Lessons Learned

In this project, we were given the opportunity to make our own choices in terms of the dataset to use, scientific questions we wanted to answer, and variables necessary for our analysis. In making these choices, I learned lessons about data dichotomization, model choice, and sensitivity analyses.

This project borrows from the [original report](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186233) created from the analysis of the dataset and attempts to answer many of the same questions, on a simpler scale.
